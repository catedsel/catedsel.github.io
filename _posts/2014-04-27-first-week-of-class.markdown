<p class="blog-post">
	This past week was our first real adventure into using the stuff we've covered
so far in the "real" world. We learned about Jekyll, an app that "transforms your plain text into static websites and blogs", and started to implement it in our blogs. So what you're seeing right now is all made possible through Jekyll. I won't lie, I was skeptical at first and not 100% into learning about it and figuring out how to implement it. However, since I've been working on my blog this weekend I've realized how easy Jekyll makes things and I've really grown to like (almost love!) it.

My goal for this weekend was to figure out how to successfully tie in Isotope to Jekyll and I think I've succeeded... The whole layout is still a mess and I haven't really decided what I want the end result to look like but I'm pumped that I have Isotope onboard now and I can't wait to start using it. You can check it out here - <a href="thingsilike.html">Things That Make Me Happy</a> - but I'm still working on it so don't judge just yet!
