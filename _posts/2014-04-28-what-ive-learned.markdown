So I'm now in the fifth week of my FrontEnd MakerSquare program and over the past few days I've started noticing that I'm incorporating what I've learned in my various projects and adventures. Yay! This is huge and, thanks to MakerSquare, I've noticed a total improvement in the areas that I'm approaching differently.

I started this program a little worried that what we would be learning would be stuff I already knew. I came in with what I thought was pretty good knowledge of HTML and CSS and while what we've gone over is not necessarily new stuff, I can't tell you how much I've learned just by reviewing these things. Just little (sometimes huge!) tidbits that make all the difference when learning how to code. And that doesn't even include the things I've learned from my fellow classmates just in our random conversations during our breaks. Coming to class every week is such a positive experience for me because I know I am going to walk away learning something huge that I would never have learned had I continued studying/learning on my own. And in terms of JavaScript and jQuery - we've just scratched the surface so I'm super excited to get more into that. Side note: I have relatively little prior knowledge of JavaScript and jQuery so whenever we start tackling that large beast I get all kinds of pumped up.

With all of that being said, I have to share what has been the GREATEST take-away from these first five weeks. In short, my confidence in my own abilities has increased drastically. This doesn't mean I can even do the things we're working on but just having the knowledge that I've gained from the first four weeks has given me a whole new perspective on the frontend developing world. This, in turn, leads me to being more confident when considering new projects and adventures. For example, my brother asked me a theoretical question about building an app that could do XYZ and while I would not be able to create the app in question, I at least know that such a thing is possible to build. Before I would have just responded to his question with a puzzled "I have no idea" and moved on with my life, but now, with four weeks of the FrontEnd program under my belt, I was actually intrigued and confident in my answer and our discussion. There are better examples of this newfound confidence and this probably doesn't make any sense anyway but I just wanted to share this realization that I had in the past few days. It's a great feeling and I'm hopeful that the further we get into the program, the more confidence I will continue to gain.
